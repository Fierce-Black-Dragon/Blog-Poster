This is a platform where you can publish your blog. The front-end is built with React.js. For the database, I used Firebase's Firestore. As a backend language, Node.js is used. Google authentication was used, as well as Firebase hosting.
The following are some of the features of this website:
1. You can use Google authentication.
2. A blog can be created or deleted by the user ( edit feature will be add in future commit).
